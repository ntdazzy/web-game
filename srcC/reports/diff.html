    <h1>UI Diff Report</h1>
    <p class="note">This file is a placeholder for automated UI comparison results.  A future
        Playwright/Puppeteer script can populate it with DOM diffs and
        screenshot comparisons between the original site (srcA) and the
        converted PHP application (srcB).  For now the conversion script
        focuses on structural transformation and leaves visual testing to
        subsequent tooling.</p>
